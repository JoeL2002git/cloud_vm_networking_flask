Flask on Cloud VM

# AHI 504 — Cloud Foundations for Health Informatics  
## Lab: Deploy a Flask App on a Cloud VM  

**Purpose.** Learn how to configure and expose, via networking configurations, a simple web application on a cloud-hosted virtual machine (VM). You will (1) choose a cloud provider, (2) create and configure a VM with an open port, (3) install and run a Flask app, and (4) make the app accessible on the internet.  

**What you’ll gain.** Hands-on practice with networking (firewall rules, ports), package installation (Python), application hosting, and optional domain name setup. This builds on the VM lifecycle skills from Assignment 1.

### Notes:

Followed the step but am unsure what went wrong. Suspect it has to do with my fire wall rule but watched zoom replay and am pretty sure I followed the step exactly. Might have missed something, please watch the video and point out my mistake. Thank you!

P.S.

Or did I used the incorrect IP address? but does it matter since I allow all IP address I thought.
